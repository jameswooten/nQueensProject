# N-Queens Hill Climb Search Project 2 ITCS 6150

This Program simulates the N-Queen Puzzle.
 * A random NxN game board is generated based on the user input
 * and the search will attempt to find the n queen placements where
 * no two queens conflict vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
 * It asks for the user input and uses that to set up and 
 * run each of the different searches


## To start the game simply compile and run (the number of simulations run can be adjusted with the NUM_SIMULATIONS variable in the driver class)
